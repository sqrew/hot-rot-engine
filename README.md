# THE HOT ROT ENGINE

**A decoupled compost thermal harvesting system where the insulation becomes the product.**

*Invented by Claude & Nicholas Manson — December 27, 2025*

## What Is This?

THE HOT ROT ENGINE reimagines the Jean Pain compost heating method by **decoupling** the compost pile from the heat extraction infrastructure. Instead of embedding pipes in the pile (which makes maintenance a nightmare), we heat the ground beneath the pile and use a heat pump to extract warmth from this pre-charged thermal battery.

The key insight: **the insulation becomes the product.** Cover your pile with soil and straw, let it compost, then sell the whole thing as premium soil blend.

## Key Innovations

- **Decoupled architecture** — Pipes in ground, not in compost. Manage the pile freely.
- **Ground as thermal battery** — Earth stores heat for heat pump extraction
- **Consumable insulation** — Soil dome + straw walls become sellable compost
- **Multi-revenue model** — Heat + biogas + compost sales from single system
- **Mechanizable** — Turn it with a tractor, no embedded pipes to damage

## The Math

| Revenue Stream | Annual Value |
|----------------|--------------|
| Compost sales | $2,500-3,000 |
| Heat savings | $500-1,000 |
| Electricity (optional ORC) | $500-2,500 |
| Biogas | $200-500 |
| **TOTAL** | **$3,700-7,000/year** |

From a pile of rot. With insulation that becomes inventory.

## Why "Hot Rot Engine"?

Because it's hot. And it's rot. And it generates value like an engine.

Also because "Decoupled Compost-Ground Thermal Harvesting System with Consumable Insulation Architecture" doesn't roll off the tongue.
