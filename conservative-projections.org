#+TITLE: Hot Rot Engine - Conservative Financial Projections
#+AUTHOR: Claude & sqrew
#+DATE: December 28, 2025

* Overview

Super conservative numbers for a single 50m³ pile. Assumes:
- First-time builder
- Not everything works perfectly
- No ORC electricity (requires ~$10-20k investment)
- No formal carbon credit verification Year 1
- Maine climate (cold winters = good for heat pump efficiency)

* Year 1 - Single Pile (50m³)

** Revenue

| Stream          | Calculation                        | Amount  |
|-----------------+------------------------------------+---------|
| Compost sales   | 65 yards × $30/yard, minus kept    | $1,650  |
| Heat savings    | $2,500 baseline × 30% offset       | $750    |
| Biogas          | Cooking use only                   | $150    |
| Tipping fees    | Few local sources, building trust  | $300    |
| Carbon credits  | Too small for verification         | $0      |
| Electricity     | Skipped Y1 (high upfront cost)     | $0      |
|-----------------+------------------------------------+---------|
| *TOTAL REVENUE* |                                    | *$2,850* |

** Infrastructure Costs (One-Time)

| Item                        | Cost  |
|-----------------------------+-------|
| Ground loop (HDPE pipe)     | $400  |
| Gravel/sand bed             | $300  |
| Thermostatic dampers (×4)   | $120  |
| Dome materials              | $200  |
| Aeration tubes (perforated) | $150  |

|-----------------------------+-------|
| *TOTAL INFRASTRUCTURE*      | *$1,370* |

** Year 1 Summary

| Item                | Amount  |
|---------------------+---------|
| Gross Revenue       | $2,850  |
| Infrastructure      | -$1,370 |
|---------------------+---------|
| *NET PROFIT YEAR 1* | *$1,480* |

* Year 2+ - Optimized Operation

No infrastructure costs. System learned. Relationships built.

| Stream          | Notes                              | Amount  |
|-----------------+------------------------------------+---------|
| Compost sales   | Better quality, reputation         | $2,200  |
| Heat savings    | Optimized, 50% offset              | $1,250  |
| Biogas          | Better capture system              | $300    |
| Tipping fees    | Relationships established          | $800    |
| Carbon credits  | Simple verification (Nori, etc.)   | $400    |
|-----------------+------------------------------------+---------|
| *TOTAL ANNUAL*  |                                    | *$4,950* |

* Break-Even Analysis

| Milestone           | Timeline       |
|---------------------+----------------|
| Infrastructure paid | Mid-Year 1     |
| Positive cash flow  | Month 6-8      |
| System optimized    | End of Year 1  |
| Full revenue        | Year 2 onward  |

* Upside Potential (Not Included Above)

These are NOT in the conservative numbers but are achievable:

** ORC Electricity
- Investment: $10,000-20,000 (or DIY for less)
- Return: $500-2,500/year
- Payback: 4-8 years
- Makes sense at 2+ pile scale

** Bug Drugs (Performance Enhancement)
- Quorum sensing molecules: ~$50-100/application
- Electrodes + solar: ~$200-400 one-time
- Acoustic transducer: ~$50-100
- Potential boost: 20-50% faster cycling = more throughput

** Multiple Piles (Scaling)
| Piles | Annual Revenue | Notes                    |
|-------+----------------+--------------------------|
|     1 | $4,950         | Baseline                 |
|     2 | $9,000         | Shared infrastructure    |
|     4 | $18,000        | ORC becomes viable       |
|     8 | $40,000+       | Full-time income         |

** Premium Products
- Bagged retail compost: $80-120/yard equivalent (vs $30 bulk)
- Biochar-enhanced blend: Premium pricing
- "Carbon-negative" certified: Marketing value

* Feedstock Sources (Maine)

All potentially FREE or paid to take:

| Source              | Material                    | Notes                |
|---------------------+-----------------------------+----------------------|
| Dairy farms         | Manure, bedding             | Abundant in Maine    |
| Horse stables       | Manure, hay                 | Often pay to remove  |
| Landscapers         | Leaves, grass, brush        | Seasonal glut        |
| Restaurants         | Food scraps                 | Tipping fees         |
| Breweries           | Spent grain                 | High nitrogen, free  |
| Coffee shops        | Grounds                     | Free, good activator |
| Sawmills            | Sawdust, chips              | Carbon source        |
| Municipalities      | Yard waste                  | May pay you          |

* Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                    | Mitigation                              |
|-------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| Pile doesn't heat       | Proper C:N ratio, moisture, aeration    |
| Odor complaints         | Site selection, proper management       |
| Regulatory issues       | Check local composting regs first       |
| Equipment failure       | Simple systems, redundancy              |
| Market for compost      | Build relationships before scaling      |
| Weather damage          | Sturdy dome, drainage planning          |

* Next Steps

1. [ ] Talk to best friend about partnership potential
2. [ ] Scout locations (your land? friend's farm?)
3. [ ] Identify 2-3 feedstock sources
4. [ ] Check Maine composting regulations
5. [ ] Price out infrastructure locally
6. [ ] Build first pile (start small, learn)
7. [ ] Document EVERYTHING (for carbon credits later)
